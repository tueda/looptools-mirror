To install LoopTools you need a Fortran-77 compiler, GNU make, gcc,
and g++. Once you've got these installed, the rest should be 
straightforward:

- Run ./configure to configure the GNUmakefile.

- Run gmake to build the libraries and binaries.

- (Optional) Add $HOME/ff/$HOSTTYPE to your path or copy the files in
  $HOME/ff/$HOSTTYPE to a public location (e.g. /usr/local/lib for the
  libraries and /usr/local/bin for bca).

Please send bug reports to hahn@particle.uni-karlsruhe.de.

Some things to check in case of problems:

- Check your path, it may not contain optional software in directories
  like /opt/f77/bin.

- If the bca program fails to execute because of some missing library,
  you need to specify a variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH which points to the
  libraries (e.g. the Fortran run-time library). "man ld" will help you
  on this.


Have fun!
